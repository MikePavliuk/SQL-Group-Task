# Creating an information system - Computer Appliance Store
During the 4th semester at the university I had a subject called "Databases". At the end of this course my group was given a task to create our own information system (database) on a given topic. Me and Mykhailo Pavliuk (@mikepavliuk) were working on this project. We chose the topic which is already written as a header. All occuring problems were sorted out together and with the small help of our supervisor.
## Task
1. Develop a database project on a given topic:
* The database must include at least five tables;
* determine the functional requirements for the database;
* build an ER diagram;
* organize connections between entities and display their type in the diagram;
* create a relational logical database model;
* to normalize the logical relational model;
* select the exact database (specify the name of your choice) and create a database;
* fill the database with records.
2. Create queries (at least 40) that include aggregate functions, columns renaming, data grouping, tables merging, data updating and deleting.
3. The results of the work should be presented in the form of a report.
